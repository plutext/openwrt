Different Images for 8meg routers
=================================

Because the size of a ROOter image has grown with each new revision of OpenWrt, a full 
ROOter will no longer will fit into 8meg of flash memory.

Instead, you have images that have Samba (Network Sharing) support or images that
have OpenVPN support but not both together.

These images are identified by "samba" or "vpn" in the file name.

The rest of the ROOter features are present in these images but you can have
either Samba or OpenVPN but not both together.
